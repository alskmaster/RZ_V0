[Adjust] [Services] [Zabbix] - Resilient event fetch and tolerant collectors
Core
- Lightweight event.get (filter source/object=0; essential output)
- Chunking by objects (down to 1 per request) and daily windows fallback before halving
- Increased depth and on-demand helpers for ACK/TAG by eventids

Incidents Table
- Tolerant filtering without requiring source/object; use value=="1" when present
- ACKs/TAGs loaded on-demand when options/filters request them

Incidents Charts / MTTR / Heatmap / Root Cause
- Same tolerant strategy (conditional masks; PROBLEM via value=="1" when available)

Reliability
- Reduced Zabbix 500s by lowering payload and partitioning
